### Hi! 👋 I'm Permata Ayu 

I'm a Machine Learning Enthusiast with a strong passion for building smart solutions using Python and state-of-the-art ML algorithms. I enjoy diving deep into data, creating predictive models, and exploring how machines can understand images, texts, and patterns.

I’ve worked on various projects involving:

- 🧠 Machine Learning & Deep Learning (TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, PyTorch)
- 🐍 Python for Data Analysis and Modeling
- 📊 Data Preprocessing, Feature Engineering, and Model Evaluation
- 🖼️ Image Processing & Computer Vision (also experienced using MATLAB)
- 💡 Building real-world ML solutions & academic research projects

---

💼 **Currently working on:**
- Improving model accuracy and performance on text & image datasets
- Researching interpretable ML and model explainability
- Experimenting with end-to-end ML deployment and model optimization

🎓 **Learning goals:**
- MLOps & model deployment (Docker, FastAPI, TensorFlow Serving)
- Cloud-based ML (GCP, AWS, Microsoft ML)

📬 **Reach me at:** https://www.linkedin.com/in/permatayu/ 

🎶 **Fun fact:** I enjoy learning new tools by turning them into projects!
